# Face Detection
 The face detection will contain 4 files namely  
 * emotion-classification-cnn-using-keras.py
 * face.ipynb
 * model.h5
 * haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

 _The emotion classification_ contains the training for the model using haarcascade_frontal_face values.

 _Model.h5_ is the trained model with the proper weights and classifications done. To use the model just run the face.ipynb file and upload the image that you want to detect. you can alter the source by changing the source from the image to video by just refering the opencv documents or any sorts of gpts.


#### Archive.zip file contains the imags for training the model.

Note: the model.h5 is a pretrained model trained using the images in archive.zip along with the _haarcascade_frontal_face_default.xml_ file.
